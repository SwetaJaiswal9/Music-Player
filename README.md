Front End of a Music Player App (using HTML and CSS)

# Features

There are 2 screens of Music Player:
1) Home Screen
2) Single Playlist Screen 

Both screens are connected via links.

•	We can go from Home Screen to Single Playlist Screen by clicking on any Artist in Popular Artist Section.

•	We can go from Single Playlist Screen to Home Screen by clicking on the Logo.

# Some Points

•	Single Playlist Screen for popular artist 'Taylor Swift' has been created.

•	Audios are just made using <audio> tags. Proper functionality of audio will require use of JavaScript and Backend.
